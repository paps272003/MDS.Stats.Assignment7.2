Here, n(No of trials) = 50,
 k(Count of Success in n trials) = 5, 
 n - k = 45(Count of failures in n trials)

The probability of success = probability of getting a “D”= s = 1/5=0.2
Hence, the probability of failure = probability of not getting a “D” = 1 - s = 4/5=0.8

P(5)=((50!)*(0.2)^5*(0.8)^45)/(5!)*(45!)
    =0.02953 approx
